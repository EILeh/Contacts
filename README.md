Contacts

In this program, a semicolon will be used as the separator character of CSV
format input files. The separator character could also be any other
character. The program reads the contact information from a file that contains
the contact information in CSV-format so that the first line contains the titles
of the columns. The information can be accessed from dict by the title of the 
CSV-file column. The information can be accessed by the key presented in the 
first column of the line.
